## Getting Started with Pinata

Whether you're brand new to IPFS or a seasoned developer, Pinata makes it simple to store and retrieve content with speed and security. All you need to kick off your journey is a [free Pinata account](https://app.pinata.cloud/register)!

### 1. Get API key and Gateway URL

/>

Inside the [Pinata App](https://app.pinata.cloud) select "API Keys" from the sidebar, then click "New Key" in the top right. We would recommend starting with Admin privileges and unlimited uses to start. You will receive a `pinata_api_key`, `pinata_api_secret`, and a `JWT`. The JWT is the most common authentication method and what we'll be using below.

Next you will want to grab your Dedicated Gateway domain by clicking the Gateways tab in the sidebar. You should see it listed in the format `fun-llama-300.mypinata.cloud` and you will want to copy it exactly like that.

### 2. Install and Setup SDK

In the root of your project run the install command with your package manager of choice.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i pinata
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm i pinata
```

```bash yarn
yarn add pinata
```

```bash bun
bun i pinata
```

</CodeGroup>

Import and initialize the SDK in your codebase with the API key and Gateway from the previous step

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: "PINATA_JWT",
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});
```

<Note>The `PINATA_JWT` is a secret key, be sure to initialize the SDK in a secure environment and practice basic variable security practices. If you need to upload from a client environment, consider using signed JWTs</Note>


### 2. Upload a File

Use the `upload` method to upload a File object.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript SDK
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const file = new File(["hello"], "Testing.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
    const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file);
    console.log(upload);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await main();
```

```typescript API
const JWT = "PINATA_JWT";

async function pinFileToIPFS() {
  try {
    const text = "Hello World!";
    const blob = new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" });
    const file = new File([blob], "hello-world.txt");
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append("file", file);

    const request = await fetch(
      "https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinFileToIPFS",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
        },
        body: data,
      }
    );
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await pinFileToIPFS();
```
</CodeGroup>

You should get a response object like the one below

```typescript
{
  IpfsHash: "bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq",
  PinSize: 20,
  Timestamp: "2024-02-03T18:42:14.989Z"
}
```

The `IpfsHash` is more commonly recognized as the `CID`, both a hash verifying the content’s authenticity but also it serves as the address to the file.

### 3. Retrieve a File from IPFS

Use the CID or `IpfsHash` from the upload to fetch a file

<CodeGroup>
```typescript SDK
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await pinata.gateways.get("bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq");
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

main();
```

```typescript API
const GATEWAY = "my-example.mypinata.cloud";
const CID = "bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq";

async function fetchFileFromIPFS() {
  const url = `https://${GATEWAY}/ipfs/${CID}`;
  try {
    const request = await fetch(url);
    const response = await request.text();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await fetchFileFromIPFS();
// Hello World!
```
</CodeGroup>
